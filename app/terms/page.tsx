        SomaliaExpert.com is an expert witness matching service for UK immigration solicitors acting in First-tier
        Tribunal and Upper Tribunal proceedings in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. We are not a law
        firm and do not provide legal advice. Expert witnesses instructed through this service provide independent
        evidence to tribunals; their duty is to the tribunal, not to either party.
