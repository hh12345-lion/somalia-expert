          A qualified Somalia expert witness holds academic credentials (PhD, MA, or equivalent research background) in
          African Studies, Political Science, Anthropology, International Relations, or a related discipline. Field
          research experience in Somalia, Somaliland, and Puntland is essential, not optional. See{" "}

          Language expertise in Somali, Maay, and af-Tunni demonstrates the ability to assess conditions beyond
          English-language sources. Current knowledge of country conditions, including MOJ and OA country guidance,
          July 2025 CPINs, and EUAA October 2025 guidance, is required. Prior tribunal acceptance in Somalia cases
          demonstrates evidential reliability.

          Somalia expert evidence is used in UK Immigration and Asylum Chamber proceedings across England, Wales,
          Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Scottish solicitors commonly instruct experts for hearings listed in Glasgow
          and Edinburgh under Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) civil legal aid. Prior SLAB approval of expert fees is
          required before chargeable work begins.

          Immigration Tribunal Practice Direction: Expert Duties
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-[#4A5058] leading-relaxed">
          An expert&apos;s paramount duty is to the tribunal: to assist it in reaching a decision by providing an
          objective, unbiased opinion on matters within their expertise, not to advocate for either the appellant or
          the Home Office. Expert evidence should be the independent product of the expert, uninfluenced by the
          pressures of litigation.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-[#4A5058] leading-relaxed">
          Reports must address matters within the expert&apos;s expertise, cite verifiable sources, and distinguish
          fact from opinion. The expert must not express views on the credibility of the appellant or the ultimate
          legal conclusion on refugee status.
