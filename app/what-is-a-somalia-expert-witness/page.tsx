          A Somalia expert witness is an independent specialist who provides objective country condition reports for UK
          immigration tribunals in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Unlike advocates for either party, the
          expert&apos;s paramount duty is to the tribunal: to assist it in reaching a decision by providing unbiased
          opinion on matters within their expertise.

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-xl font-bold text-[#0F2420]">When to Instruct a Somalia Expert</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-[#3A4542] leading-relaxed">
          Instruct a Somalia expert witness when the Home Office refusal relies on generic CPIN positions that do not
          address the appellant&apos;s specific clan profile, region of origin, or personal risk factors. Expert evidence
          is particularly valuable in MOJ diaspora test cases, clan minority claims, Al-Shabaab targeting, FGM claims,
          and Article 15(c) south/central Somalia appeals.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-xl font-bold text-[#0F2420]">Legal Aid: Scotland (SLAB) and England/Wales (LAA)</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-[#3A4542] leading-relaxed">
          Most Somalia expert reports in UK asylum proceedings are Legal Aid funded. Scottish solicitors obtain prior
          approval from the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) before instructing country experts. Solicitors in England and
          Wales apply to the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) for prior authority. Confirm the correct funding route before
          instruction. See our{" "}

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-xl font-bold text-[#0F2420]">Report Standards</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-[#3A4542] leading-relaxed">
          Somalia expert reports comply with CPR Part 35 and Immigration Tribunal Practice Direction paragraph 10.
          Reports cite verifiable sources including July 2025 CPINs, EUAA October 2025 country guidance, MOJ and OA
          country guidance decisions, UN reports, and field research. Experts distinguish fact from opinion and do not
          express views on the appellant&apos;s credibility or ultimate refugee status.
