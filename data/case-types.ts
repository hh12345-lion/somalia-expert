    content: [
      "First-tier Tribunal asylum appeals involving Somali nationals require expert evidence addressing the appellant's specific profile against current country conditions.

Reports address the matters raised in the letter of instruction, cite verifiable sources including July 2025 CPINs and EUAA October 2025 country guidance, and provide independent analysis beyond generic Home Office positions.",

For listed hearings, allow at least 14 days for standard reports and 7 days for urgent instructions. Legal Aid cases require LAA prior authority before work begins.",

Identify whether MOJ, Article 15(c), or Somaliland/Puntland analysis applies.

Expert witnesses must demonstrate that their analysis reflects current conditions and explain any divergence from established country guidance.",
